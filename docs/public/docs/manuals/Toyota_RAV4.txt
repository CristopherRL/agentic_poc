PAGE 33 - Airbag Deployment Conditions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Deployment conditions (frontal SRS airbags):**
- Deploy when the vehicle suffers a frontal impact exceeding a set threshold
- Threshold speed is considerably higher in the following situations:
    - If the vehicle hits an object like a parked vehicle or a pole
    - If the vehicle suffers an under-ride collision (collision under a vehicle, hitting a curb edge, falling into a deep hole)
    - If the vehicle hits the top of a collision (only pretensioners may activate)

**Deployment conditions (side and curtain SRS airbags):**
- Deploy when the vehicle suffers a side impact at a force level produced by the impact force of a high-speed vehicle
- Both may deploy in the event of a severe frontal collision

**Emergency calls (vehicles with ERA-eCall/GLONASS/EVAK):**
- If one of the following occurs, the system may make an emergency call to the ERA-eCall/GLONASS/EVAK center
- An SRS airbag deploys
- Seat belt pretensioners activate without airbag deployment
- Vehicle with ERA-eCall/GLONASS/EVAK: both curtain airbags may also deploy in the event of a vehicle rollover

================================================================================
PAGE 34 - Types of Collisions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Situations where SRS may NOT deploy properly:**
Airbags may deploy even in collisions other than frontal ones. Examples shown:
- Hitting a curb, pavement edge, or hard surface
- Falling into a hole or jumping over a deep bump
- Hard landing or fall

**Vehicles with ERA-eCall/GLONASS/EVAK:**
- Curtain airbags may also deploy in situations shown in the illustration
- Vehicle's roll angle is marginal
- Vehicle slides and hits a curb

**Types of collisions that DO NOT deploy SRS airbags (frontal):**
- Frontal airbags generally do not inflate if the vehicle suffers a side or rear collision, if it rolls over, or if it is involved in a low-speed frontal collision

================================================================================
PAGE 35 - More on Collisions and Airbags
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Additional situations where SRS airbags DO NOT inflate:**
- Curtain airbags do not inflate if the vehicle is in a rear collision, if it rolls over, or is in a low-speed side collision
- Rear collision
- Pitching and rolling over

**When to contact a Toyota dealer:**
- After SRS airbags have inflated, the vehicle cannot be driven until repaired
- Contact an authorized Toyota dealer or authorized workshop as soon as possible for inspection and repair

**Conditions where SRS airbags may NOT inflate (despite damage):**
- The front of the vehicle is damaged, deformed, or involved in an accident not severe enough to cause deployment
- The door or surrounding area is damaged, deformed, or has severe SRS damage but not enough to deploy
- The rear section of the steering wheel, dashboard near the front passenger, or back of the instrument panel is scratched, cracked, or damaged

**Contact with system components:**
- The SRS airbags deploy with considerable force and may cause abrasions or injuries
- Immediately after deployment, SRS airbag components will be hot
- Do not touch any part of the components immediately after

**Ventilation after deployment:**
- If breathing becomes difficult after deployment, open a door or window
- Wash off any residue as soon as possible to prevent skin irritation

**Areas where airbags are stored:**
- If areas where SRS airbags are stored (steering wheel, dashboard, roof pillars) are scratched, cracked, or damaged, have them replaced

================================================================================
PAGE 36 - Precautions with SRS Airbags
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Warnings about deployment:**
- The driver's SRS airbag deploys with considerable force
- Being too close to the airbag can be dangerous

**Correct driver position:**
- Position yourself as far as possible from the airbag while maintaining control of the vehicle
- Place the center of the chest at least 25 cm (10 inches) from the steering wheel

**Adjustment options:**
- Recline the seatback slightly if possible
- Tilt the seatback slightly rearward (though vehicle designs vary)

**Seat position:**
- The seat should be adjusted according to the recommendations above while maintaining good reach to the steering wheel and view of the instrument panel

**Front passenger airbag:**
- Also deploys with considerable force
- Can cause serious injury, especially if the front passenger is very close to the airbag
- Position as far as possible from the airbag

**Warnings about modifications:**
- Portion of the front pillars, side roof pillars, or roof side rails is scratched, cracked, or damaged
- Portion of the seat where the side airbag is located is scratched, cracked, or damaged

================================================================================
PAGE 37 - Prohibitions with Airbags
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**What NOT to do:**

- Do not allow anyone to kneel on the passenger seat towards the door or put their head or hands out of the vehicle
- Do not place anything against areas like the door, windshield, side window, front pillar, side roof pillar, or roof handles. These items can become projectiles when airbags deploy
- Do not place anything that rests or leans against areas of the dashboard, steering wheel, instrument panel near the front passenger. These items can impede SRS airbag deployment

================================================================================
PAGE 38 - More Precautions with Airbags
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Do not use accessories that cover parts where side airbags are located:**
- Accessories can prevent correct airbag inflation, disable the system, or cause accidental deployment, resulting in death or serious injury

**Vehicles without smart entry and start system:**
- Do not place keys or accessories on the keyring. Objects can restrict the deployment of the driver's knee airbag, causing injury

**Do not hang hangers or hard objects on coat hooks:**
- All hard objects should be stored in the glove box. These objects can cause death or serious injury if the curtain airbag deploys

**If a seat cover is installed:**
- If it is placed in an area where the airbag deploys, make sure to remove it

**Ventilation:**
- If breathing becomes difficult after airbag deployment, open a door or window or leave the vehicle if it is safe to do so
- Wash off any residue as soon as possible to prevent skin irritation

**Modifications and removal of SRS:**
- If areas where SRS airbags are stored are damaged, contact a Toyota dealer for replacement
- Do not perform repairs, modifications, removal, or disassembly of airbags
- Do not install a front protection grille, fan on the roof bar, switches, or accessories on the keyring
